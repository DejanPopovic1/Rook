Todo List:
DONT FORGET TO FREE ALL MALLOCS!
Try making function pointer to iterating through the board. This will then be shared across all functions that iterate board
Error handle all malloc allocations by defining your own "wrapper" function
Move copyState into GlobalDeclarations
When creating and allocating memory for structs, make a single function that does this and intialises freeIndex to zero
We have allocated memory for strings but have not possible allocated space for null terminating character - check this
Apply const correctness
Address all compiler warnings
Cycle through previous commands
Provide USER HINTS for the next best move
Duplicate version to Linux
Thread usage
Ponder functionality
Undo Move
Randomise AI moves or keep fixed (option)
Set difficulty
Set heuristics
Display time
Timed/non timed game as argument to starting new game (multiplayer and against AI)
struct to keep all user settings as a conf object
export to PNG notation
choose movement notation
